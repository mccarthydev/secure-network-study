   *Detailed Breakdown*
------------------------------
**1. Introduction to Cryptography and Key Concepts** 

**Topics to cover:**

   * Basic cryptography concepts: Symmetric vs asymmetric encryption,
   hashing, and digital signatures.
   * Java libraries for cryptography (Java Cryptography Extension - JCE).
   * Understanding key pairs, public/private keys, and the concept of
   encryption/decryption.

**Practical Exercises:**

1. **Understand and use Java built-in cryptographic functions:**
    * Explore Cipher, KeyPairGenerator, SecretKey, MessageDigest, and Signature.
    * Create a simple program to encrypt and decrypt messages using symmetric (AES) and asymmetric (RSA) encryption.
2. **Exercise:** Implement a file encryption/decryption utility using AES and RSA.
    * Use Java libraries to generate keys and encrypt/decrypt data.

**2. TLS and MTLS**

**Topics to cover:**

   * What is TLS (Transport Layer Security) and how it works.
   * How to use Java's `SSLContext` and `SSLSocketFactory` for secure connections.
   * What is mTLS (mutual TLS), and how it adds authentication to TLS.
   * Understanding how certificates are used in establishing secure connections.

**Practical Exercises:**

1. **Setting up a TLS/SSL server and client in Java:**
    * Use `SSLContext` to create a secure server and client.
    * Set up an HTTPS server using Java’s `HttpServer` and `SSLContext` for secure communication.
2. **mTLS with Java:**
    * Configure both server and client to require client certificates (mTLS).
    * Create a secure communication scenario where the server verifies the client's identity.

**3. Working with Certificates and Certificate Authorities (CAs)**

**Topics to cover:**

* Understanding digital certificates, certificate authorities (CAs), and their role in TLS.
* How to create and use certificates in Java.
* Certificate validation and trust chains.
* Using Java’s KeyFactory, X509Certificate, and TrustManager for certificate handling.

**Practical Exercises:**

1. **Creating and managing certificates:**
    * Generate a self-signed certificate using keytool.
    * Implement a Java client and server using certificates for authentication and encryption.
2. **Validating certificates:**
    * Implement a certificate validation mechanism using Java's TrustManager to ensure that the server certificate is trusted.
    * Create a system that uses CA certificates for authentication and encryption.
