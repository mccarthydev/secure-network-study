   *Detailed Breakdown*
------------------------------
**1. Introduction to Cryptography and Key Concepts** 

**Topics to cover:**

   * Basic cryptography concepts: Symmetric vs asymmetric encryption,
   hashing, and digital signatures.
   * Java libraries for cryptography (Java Cryptography Extension - JCE).
   * Understanding key pairs, public/private keys, and the concept of
   encryption/decryption.

**Practical Exercises:**

1. **Understand and use Java built-in cryptographic functions:**
    * Explore Cipher, KeyPairGenerator, SecretKey, MessageDigest, and Signature.
    * Create a simple program to encrypt and decrypt messages using symmetric (AES) and asymmetric (RSA) encryption.
2. **Exercise:** Implement a file encryption/decryption utility using AES and RSA.
    * Use Java libraries to generate keys and encrypt/decrypt data.
